# [Yuk-or-Yum?](https://record-collection.fly.dev/)

## Don't judge a record by its sleeve... or do.

Yuk-or-Yum is a full-stack web application that allows users to share their favorite meals with the world. Users can create, edit, and delete their own meals, as well as say Yum or Yuk to other users' meals. Users can also see all the meals they have liked, and where to find them.

## [TheAudioDB API](https://www.theaudiodb.com/)
Hooking up to this API gives me access to a DB of pretty much every album released in the US. As a result, the `record-cards` auto-populate based on the information coming from `req.body`
### Endpoint - Exposed
To handle requests to the API, I'm using a `promise based HTTP client` for node.js, `Axios`. 
<br>
The following function, `fetchAlbumInfo` takes two arguments, (artist, album) from `req.body` and queries the DB for a matching album object. From there, I compile the information needed for `VYNL` into a new object, `albumData` and pass it to the records controller.
<br>
<br>
from `/src/services/api.js`

```js
async function fetchAlbumInfo(artist, album) {
  console.log(artist, album)
  const options = {
    method: 'GET',
    url: 'https://theaudiodb.p.rapidapi.com/searchalbum.php',
    params: {
      s: artist,
      a: album
    },
    headers: {
      'content-type': 'application/octet-stream',
      'X-RapidAPI-Key': process.env.MUSIC_API_SECRET,
      'X-RapidAPI-Host': 'theaudiodb.p.rapidapi.com'
    }
  };
  
  try {
    const response = await axios.request(options)
    const albumData = {
      title: response.data.album[0].strAlbum,
      artist: response.data.album[0].strArtist,
      year: response.data.album[0].intYearReleased,
      art: response.data.album[0].strAlbumThumb,
      owner: undefined
    }
    return albumData
```
### Controller Integration
In the controller, I call the `fetchAlbumInfo` function and, if an album exists, `persist` that data to the `record model`. Notice that because of the API call, I am calling `Record.create` with albumData as an argument
<br>
<br>
from `/controllers/records.js`

```js
function create(req, res) {
  fetchAlbumInfo(req.body.artist, req.body.title)
  .then(albumData => {
    if (albumData === undefined) {
      res.redirect('/records/new')
    } else {
      Record.find({ title: albumData.title, artist: albumData.artist })
      .then(records => {
        if (records.length) {
          res.redirect('/records/new')
        } else {
          albumData.owner = req.user.profile._id
          Record.create(albumData)
```

## Highlights

### Partial City
Keeping my code `DRY` has become a point of pride, and its something that I am constantly working to improve upon. To keep my EJS clean, I made use of partials. In the following code, you can see `every element on the page is a partial` (some partials are exclusively made up of other partials!)
<br>
<br>
from `/views/records/show.ejs`

```js
<%- include('../partials/html-head') %>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/stylesheets/show.css"/>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/stylesheets/partials/record-cards.css"/>
<script defer type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/record-transition.js"></script>
<%- include('../partials/nav') %>

<div class="records-show-content">
  <%- include('../partials/record-card') %>

  <div class="comment-container">
    <%- include('../partials/show/comments') %>
    <%- include('../partials/show/add-comment') %>
  </div>
  
</div>

<%- include('../partials/show/data-card') %>
<%- include('../partials/show/bio-card') %>

<%- include('../partials/footer') %>
```

### Seperation of `C`on`S`ern`S`
Most partials come with their own CSS file. Structuring my EJS and CSS in this way makes the code incredibly easy to build on with very little risk of accidentally breaking features that I am not actively working on.
